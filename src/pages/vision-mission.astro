				<p class="mb-3">
					The orange color of the Department logo is reflected in the
					design of the Centre logo, which also incorporates green,
					representing "safety and hope." The capital letters "C",
					"F", "S" in the logo stand for "Centre for Food Safety." The
					"F" forms the main body, flanked by two circles containing
					"C" and "S," signifying partnership in food safety and
					echoing the Centre's mission to enhance food safety through
					proactive collaboration among the Government, food trade,
					and consumers.
