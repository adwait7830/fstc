						FSSAI License
					</h3>
					<p>
						Product Approval and Label Validation are two important
						parts of the Food Safety Management System, ensuring
						compliance with FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards
						Authority of India).
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						A Food Safety Management Plan with complete
						documentation and a standard operational process in line
						is essential for a business to be FSSAI compliant.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h4 class="font-medium text-xl">
						Key Factors for FSSAI Compliance
					</h4>
					<br />
					<h5 class="text-lg">Product Approval Validation (PAV):</h5>
					<p>
						It is a process by which any novel ingredient(s) or
						additive(s) not prescribed in the act/regulation can be
						approved by FSSAI. An FBO needs to get his product
						approved before the licensing procedure and release into
						the market.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h5 class="text-lg">Label Validation (LV):</h5>
					<p>
						Label Validation means ensuring the information and the
						format of the product's label are accurate and comply
						with FSSAI regulations. This maintains complete
						transparency with respect to the product information,
						helping consumers make informed purchases.
